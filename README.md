# Fake Instagram Followers Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

In this project I am aiming to develop a machine learning model for predicting the percentage of fake followers of Instagram accounts. It differentiates between real and fake followers based on various factors such as Username, Bio, Followers, Followings,  Follow Ratio, and Post Count.

The process involves collecting a dataset of real and fake accounts. This dataset will be used as training data for the predictive model, so the model learn to distinguish between real and fake followers. After successful training, the model is evaluated using different real test datasets to assess its performance in identifying fake and real accounts. The evaluation provides very clear insights into model's ability to distinguish between real and fake followers.

## Skillset Demonstrated

- **AI/ML:** Machine learning algorithms for follower classification.
- **Sklearn:** Implemented machine learning models from this library.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Preprocessed and transformed raw data for model training.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualized data, classification results, and performance metrics.
- **Python:** Developed the project and scripts using Python programming language.
- **Excel:** Created datasets for model training and evaluation.
- **Statistics:** Applied statistical analysis techniques to evaluate model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualized data and classification results.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored follower data to gain more insights.
- **Data Manipulation:** Manipulated data for pre-processing.
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and sanitized raw follower data for training.
- **Web Scraping:** Retrieved follower data from Instagram using web scraping techniques selenium and python automation.
- **Feature Engineering:** For extracting useful features from the raw dataset.
- **Web Development (Frontend):** Developed front-end using HTML/CSS for interacting with the application.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your computer.
2. **Python App:** Run `app.py` in the "Python App" folder to directly check the fake followers percentage of any Instagram account. (Before that, Refer to the separate readme file provided in that folder and install dependencies before launching `app.py`.)
3. **Review Project:** Open `end_to_end_Complete_Project.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook to review the complete project.
